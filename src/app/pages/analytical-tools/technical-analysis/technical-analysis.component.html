           <p> Technical analysis is a quantitative approach, extracting statistics from historical price data and presenting the results in charts and overlays. 
               It lends itself to Forex technical trading and this article will explain how traders go about it.</p><br>
               <p> As with many other asset classes found in the markets, technical analysis is a technique used to predict future Forex price movements. 
                   It utilizes some elements of historical price data as inputs: opening and closing prices as well as the highest and lowest prices in between them.</p><br>
                <p> Volume can also be used but that is difficult to measure accurately in the Forex markets. It’s not as clear cut as with stocks market.</p><br>
               <h6>The broader picture</h6>
               <p>Charts form the core of technical analysis in Forex but there are numerous methods, tools, and techniques employed as well. 
                   The main benefit of charts is that they present the price history data in an easy to understand visual format. 
                   That makes it quick and easy to identify patterns. Traders use these price patterns to guide them in placing profitable trades. 
                   The patterns are market formations or ‘moods’ and examples include range, reversal and trend patterns.</p><br>
                   <p>The key to successfully interpreting the patterns is to discern the market’s current mood and when it will change. 
                       Traders then use their judgment, based on this technical analysis, in planning their trades. 
                       They are assisted in identifying significant patterns by long-established charting tools that include lines representing price 
                       channels and market support or resistance about certain price points. More advanced online tools provide a diverse range of technical indicators, 
                       which are overlaid on the charts in real time.</p><br>
                       <h6>The benefits of Technical Analysis</h6>
                       <p>Analyzing financial markets successfully is not a simple task. At every moment, the markets are affected by a diverse array of external forces or influences. 
                           They range from government fiscal policy and the dictates of their central banks to consumer trends and corporate initiatives. 
                           The effort involved in assessing all of those factors and understanding which of them represent the biggest impact is extremely difficult as you can imagine.</p><br>
                           <p>Just as significantly, traders could easily misinterpret the cause and effect of these events. 
                               That is especially the case when individuals have only limited time to devote to analysis. 
                               Technical analysis (TA), on the other hand, enables traders to focus on just one factor and that is price movement. 
                               It is also called chart analysis and focuses on historical up and down changes in prices.</p><br>
                   <h6>Technical analysis benefits traders in these ways:</h6>
                   <ul>
                       <li><p>How to identify when a chart looks promising</p></li>
                       <li><p>A method of quickly interpreting a chart</p></li>
                       <li><p>What characteristics to assess to find potential trading opportunities</p></li>
                       <li><p>How to then correctly manage the trades to maximize their success</p></li>
                   </ul><br>
                   <h6>Trending prices</h6>
               <p>The way prices tend to move in trends is a market feature that technical analysts like. 
                   A rising, bullish, market exhibits uptrends of continuously rising prices over time with higher highs and lower lows. 
                   That may be true even if the prices appear to change up and down more erratically over much shorter time periods. 
                   The opposite is true of falling, bearish, markets where downtrends appear as lower lows and lower highs.</p><br>
                   <p>Patterns are the core of Forex technical analysis. Market trends are proven to exist and they are critical to technical traders. 
                       While daily technical analysis in Forex may be dismissed by some academics as leading to insolvency, 
                       it is widely practiced in most financial markets, often alongside other types of analysis.</p><br>
