                <p>Forex is the preferred market for very many traders because they appreciate why it’s the best market for trading in. Experienced traders examine what online markets have available and grab hold of the best opportunities on offer. What makes the Forex market the best for trading? 
                    The answer is that there are very many reasons, which we will describe in a moment, after we have had a quick look at the Forex market’s history.</p><br>
               <h6>Exploring the Forex Market of 2019</h6>
               <p>The foreign exchange currency market (also known as FX or Forex) is by far the world’s largest financial market and also the one with the greatest liquidity. The Internet brought the advent of a retail side in the late 1990s because traders were able to use online trading platforms. 
                   This is also when retail online brokers came into existence.</p><br>
                    <p>For many decades prior to that, since Forex first began, clients were mainly banks and brokerage houses, or institutional clients in other words. Retail is still a relatively minor portion (5% or about250 billion US dollars daily) of the trillions that are traded every day. You may well wonder why the Forex market is so huge.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Business needs foreign currency in order to trade internationally. Large global corporations, hedge funds and financial institutions are just some. 
                        They buy one currency using another currency, which generates vast volumes of funds flowing through Forex – the global currency market.</p><br>
                        <h6>5 Great Reasons for choosing the Forex market for trading</h6>
                  <p>Forex has something for every type of trader. Not everybody wants the same features and benefits but these are the most common reasons, according to traders</p><br>
                   <ol>
                    <li><p><span>Constant Volatility-</span> Volatility means constantly changing prices, both rising and falling. That means many opportunities to buy<br>
                        at low prices and sell high, or vice versa. Volatility is what attracts traders in the first place.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Easily Accessed-</span>The majority of Forex traders use online broker services and platforms. Getting started is fast and easy<br>
                        simply register, submit identification documents, lodge trading funds, and you are ready to go. It really is simple to get started.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Technological Advances-</span>Technology made online trading possible and advances have never stood still. This has opened up<br>
                        Forex for attractive trading propositions and made it the most potentially profitable of all markets.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Options to buy or sell-</span>In Forex trading, you can sell currency without having to buy or own it. That technique is known as short<br>
                        selling or ‘going short’. To illustrate the principle, consider you have 10,000 EUR in your online broker trading account. Say you are<br>
                        thinking of trading the USD/JPY currency pair. You can open a position that sells Yen in exchange for US Dollars even though your<br>
                        balance is in Euros.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Conditions and costs-</span>Low costs are critical for day traders, especially professionals. Commissions and spreads in Forex are<br>
                        generally low – as low as two pips, or even one pip with some currency pairs at times.</p></li>
